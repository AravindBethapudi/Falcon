## About This Project

This end-to-end machine learning project demonstrates my ability to build predictive models and analyze trends in SpaceX Falcon 9 launches. The goal is to predict the first stage landing success, enhancing mission planning and risk assessment.

## Achievements

- Designed an efficient feature engineering pipeline to improve model performance.
- Achieved an 85% accuracy in predicting SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landing success.
- Identified key features influencing landing success, such as payload mass and orbit type.
- Visualized critical trends using interactive plots for better interpretability.

## Dataset

The dataset contains historical SpaceX launch data, including features like:
- `Launch Date`: The date of the rocket launch.
- `Rocket Type`: The model of the rocket.
- `Launch Site`: The location of the launch.
- `Payload Mass`: The weight of the payload in kilograms.
- `Orbit Type`: The target orbit of the payload.
- `Landing Outcome`: Indicates whether the first stage successfully landed (1 for success, 0 for failure).
